# About
My name is Fae and I decided to compile LGTBQ+ content into one blog. If you have any recommendations, please let me know. :)


## Definitions

**Yuri (Japanese: 百合; lit. "lily")**, is a term used within Japanese media to describe intimate relationships (either emotional and spiritual, rather than romantic or sexual) between female characters.

**Boys' love (Japanese: ボーイズ ラブ)**, or **Yaoi**, on the other hand, _IS_ a genre (usually) depicting homoerotic relationships between male characters.
