A laid-back freshman attending Gatagata Girls' High School who ends up joining the DIY Club. She is very accident-prone, with a perfect attendance record at the nurse's office. Because of her being prone to injury, she is often seen with bandages on her body. Her name in Japanese order is a homonym of the "yourself" in "do it yourself".
