A documentary by Kim Longinoto and Jano Williams (DREAM GIRLS), which offers rich, and perhaps rare, insight into gender and sexuality in Japan via Kazuki, Tatsu, and Gaish – three trans masculine hosts working at the New Marilyn Club in Shinjuku. The film follows all three at their respective homes and at their job.
